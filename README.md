# SELF-DRVING-AI-CAR


This Python script leverages the NEAT algorithm to train neural networks for controlling a car in a Pygame-based simulation. Inspired by "Cheesy AI" and optimized by Florian Dedov from "NeuralNine," the code demonstrates how neuroevolution can be applied to a simulated environment.

### Overview:

- **Car Simulation**: A car navigates a map using radar sensors to detect obstacles. The `Car` class manages the car's movement, collision detection, and sensor data processing.
  
- **NEAT Algorithm**: The script evolves neural networks over multiple generations, with each network controlling a car. The goal is to train the cars to navigate the map efficiently without crashing.

- **Simulation Loop**: The `run_simulation` function handles the main loop, updating the carâ€™s position, checking for collisions, and rendering the car on the map. The simulation ends when all cars crash or a time limit is reached.

- **Visualization**: Pygame is used to display the car, sensors, and simulation stats like the current generation and the number of cars still alive.
